# Simulation-of-Segway---Inverse-pendulum
C++ code that simulates the behaviour of a self-regulating inverse pendulum - a segway.
### How does it work?
Execution of main file generates a text-file "segway.txt", that contains the simulated values for the four unknown entities-time,displacement , acceleration and energy
### About Segway:
A Segway PT - short for Segway Personal Transporter - is a two-wheeled,
self-balancing personal transporter.

For more details on underlying phenomenon and math-
please refer to the file Segway_background

### About
This project is part of my cirriculum (Computational Materials Sciences - Introduction to Scientific programming) where the structure and some parts of the project are given and the code should be completed.
